The project is split into 3 main applications:
1. A microcontroller application is designed to acquire data from the Lidar at different positions.
2. A desktop application has been designed to collect the information from the sensor.
3. A data processing application takes the acquired measurements and calculates the Cartesian coordinates of each pixel based on the parameters of the scan.
